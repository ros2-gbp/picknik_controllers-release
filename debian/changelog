ros-rolling-picknik-reset-fault-controller (0.0.1-2noble) noble; urgency=high

  * Initial Release of picknik_reset_fault_controller
    * Originally this was used internally and there was an attempt to release it to ros2_controllers
    * After discussion with the ros2 controllers WG over slack we have decided to open source it here first
    * The goal is to still move this upstream but it can be worked on here first and moved in the future
  * fault_controller -> picknik_reset_fault_controller (#2 <https://github.com/PickNikRobotics/picknik_controllers/issues/2>)
    * fault_controller -> picknik_reset_fault_controller
    This commit does two things:
    1) renames fault_controller to reset_fault_controller
    2) prefixes with picknik_
    The first change, is to be more specific what this controller is used
    for.
    The second change is because we want to move this controller into
    ros2_controllers and when that is complete we can drop the picknik_ and
    depricate this version allowing for a transition period.
